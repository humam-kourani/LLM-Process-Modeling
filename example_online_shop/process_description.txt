Consider a process for purchasing items from an online shop. The user starts an order by logging in to their account. Then, the user simultaneously selects the items to purchase and sets a payment method. Afterward, the user either pays or completes an installment agreement. After selecting the items, the user chooses between multiple options for a free reward. Since the reward value depends on the purchase value, this step is done after selecting the items, but it is independent of the payment activities. Finally, the items are delivered. The user has the right to return items for exchange. Every time items are returned, a new delivery is made.
