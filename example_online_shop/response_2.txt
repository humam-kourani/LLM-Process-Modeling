Given the error message and instructions, let's revise the process model to ensure that we do not create a partial order as a direct child of another partial order. We can incorporate all required de
pendencies into a single partial order by combining the dependencies at the same hierarchical level, taking care to sequence activities correctly without violating the requirements.

```python
from utils.model_generation import ModelGenerator
gen = ModelGenerator()

login = gen.activity('Login')
select_items = gen.activity('Select items')
set_payment_method = gen.activity('Set payment method')
pay = gen.activity('Pay')
complete_installment = gen.activity('Complete installment agreement')
select_reward = gen.activity('Select free reward')
deliver_items = gen.activity('Deliver items')
return_items = gen.activity('Return items')

# Exclusive Choices
payment_choice = gen.xor(pay, complete_installment)

# Loop for Delivery and Return Process
delivery_return_loop = gen.loop(do=deliver_items, redo=return_items)

# Since the error was about direct children of partial orders, we simplify by reconsidering how we link our dependencies
# Considering all dependencies at the same hierarchical level:
final_dependencies = [
    (login, select_items),
    (login, set_payment_method),
    (select_items, payment_choice),
    (select_items, select_reward),
    (set_payment_method, payment_choice),
    (payment_choice, delivery_return_loop),
    (select_reward, delivery_return_loop)
]

# Generating the updated final model without violating the partial order directive
final_model = gen.partial_order(dependencies=final_dependencies)
```
